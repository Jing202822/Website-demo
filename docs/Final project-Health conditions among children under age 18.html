<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data needed for analysis is downloaded from <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/health-conditions-among-children-under-age-18-by-selected-characteristics-united-states-53b56">data.gov</a>. The original data has been published from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Jun 2021<span class="citation" data-cites="healthc2023">(<a href="#ref-healthc2023" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Health Conditions Among Children Under Age 18, by Selected Characteristics: United States”</span> 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This data set consists of information about the health conditions among children under 18 years old based on particular population characteristics. It can help get information regarding the illness that is prevalent among minors, the percentage of children for each illness based on the different demographic characteristics, and more.</p>

<h1>Overview &amp; Clean the data set</h1>
<section id="overview-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>The data set includes 16 columns. The column “INDICATOR” consists of the information about the whole data set, which is “Health conditions among children under age 18” and is a characteristic variable. The column “PANEL” is a characteristic variable and includes information about various health issues. The column “PANEL_NUM” represents the code for different health issues. The column “UNIT” indicates the number in the data set focused on percentage. “UNIT_NUM” refers to the code representing the characteristic variables in the “UNIT” column. “STUB_NAME” includes different characteristics for the respondents, like age, race, sex, etc., and the “STUB_NAME_NUM” shows the codes related to them. “STUB_LABEL” means the sub-variables related to the characteristics, like different age groups, female and male for the gender, and column “STUB_LABEL_NUM” involves the number representing them. “YEAR” includes information about different year stages, “YEAR_NUM” represents them, “AGE” and “AGE_NUM” include different age stages and numbers represent them, “ESTIMATE” is the number percent of children, “SE” means the standard error. In the “FLAG” column, “—” means the data is not available, and “*” means the estimate might not be reliable.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2019/012-508.pdf">document</a>&nbsp;provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides some important notes for the data set. The demographic characteristics “Total” include information for all other races that are not shown separately and the unknown insurance status<span class="citation" data-cites="healthc2019">(<a href="#ref-healthc2019" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Health Conditions Among Children Under Age 18, by Selected Characteristics: United States, Average Annual, Selected Years 1997<span></span>1999 Through 2016<span></span>2018”</span> 2019</a>)</span>. Besides, the categories in the “Insurance status” characteristics are mutually exclusive, which means that the “Insured” category does not cover the information provided in the “Insured: private” and “Insured: Medicaid.” It means that combining these three categories for future analysis is appropriate<span class="citation" data-cites="healthc2019">(<a href="#ref-healthc2019" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Health Conditions Among Children Under Age 18, by Selected Characteristics: United States, Average Annual, Selected Years 1997<span></span>1999 Through 2016<span></span>2018”</span> 2019</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>To clean the data, delete the columns that include some repeat information, like the number representing the variables, the columns that only include one piece of information, like the “INDICATOR” column, and the rows that contain the not available cells, are necessary. Besides, arranging the table through “PANEL” and “YEAR,” renaming the column, and using the information in the “SE” column (standard error) to calculate the upper and lower percentage information will make the table more in order and easier to understand.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary-the-numerical-variables--percentage">Summary the numerical variables- percentage</h2>
<p>To summarize the numerical variables “percentage” (or percent of the students), grouping the variable into the different demographic categories based on various illnesses is necessary. The summary includes information about the central tendency of the percentage, including the mean and median. It aims to describe the center of distribution of data<span class="citation" data-cites="conwaya">(<a href="#ref-conwaya" role="doc-biblioref">Conway, n.d.b</a>)</span>. The summary also includes range, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and quartile information. It shows the variability or the differences between values in this numerical variable and can determine whether or not the variable “percentage” contains the extreme variable<span class="citation" data-cites="conwaya">(<a href="#ref-conwaya" role="doc-biblioref">Conway, n.d.b</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="3.2-id">(<a href="#ref-3.2-id" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“3.2 - Identifying Outliers: IQR Method,”</span> n.d.</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The formula used to determine the extreme variable, or outlier, is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>IQR = Q3 – Q1</p></li>
<li><p>upper fence=Q3 + (1.5 * IQR)</p></li>
<li><p>lower fence=Q1 – (1.5 * IQR)</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-year-and-year-number">About the year and year number</h2>
<p>As the “year” is the categorical variable and represents the range of years, it might not be suitable to use it to show the trend of the percentage of children changing over time by using the liner graphic. Instead, the year_number is a numerical variable and includes the information for various year ranges, so using it in future analysis is more appropriate. This section aims to show how the information in the “year” column matches the information in the “year_number” column, which hopes to make the graphic below easier to understand.</p>

How do we reorder the categories based on the definition?</h4>
<p>The percentage is computed using U.S. Census Bureau poverty thresholds and family income and size information<span class="citation" data-cites="healthc2019">(<a href="#ref-healthc2019" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Health Conditions Among Children Under Age 18, by Selected Characteristics: United States, Average Annual, Selected Years 1997<span></span>1999 Through 2016<span></span>2018”</span> 2019</a>)</span>. It can used to set the “poverty lines.” <span class="citation" data-cites="2024fed2024">(<a href="#ref-2024fed2024" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“2024 Federal Poverty Levels / Guidelines &amp; How They Determine Medicaid Eligibility”</span> 2024</a>)</span>. The way to understand the percentage could be, for instance, the annual income for the “400% or more” percentage level is four times the annual income for the 100% level. Accordingly, the order for the categories within the poverty level should be “Below 100%”, “100%-199%”, “200%-399%”, and “400% or more.”</p>

<p>Some observation for the graphics above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The trends for all characteristics over time are going down, except the “Two or more races” in the “Race” category.</li>
<li>Based on “Hay fever or respiratory allergy” illness, the higher percentage for the different poverty levels over time is different from the previous analysis for the poverty level. The reason for the differences might be the analysis in question 2 includes multiple illnesses and is based on the percentage median.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Aged between 10-17 years old, Males are more likely to get “Hay fever or respiratory allergy” over time compared to other ages (which refers to 0-4 years old, 5-17 years old, and 5-9 years old) and sex groups (which refers to female).</li>

<p>Some observations for the graphics above:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Almost all the demographic characteristics are increasing over time. However, the category “American Indian or Alaska Native only” within the “Race” demographic characteristic has a slightly downward trend.</p></li>
<li><p>The analysis for poverty levels for the “Skin Allergy” analysis shows that the percentage for levels “Below 100%” will sometimes be higher than other levels. This finding matches the observation in question but differs from when analyzing the “Hay fever or respiratory allergy” illness.</p></li>
<li><p>0-4 years old and female (except the 2012-2014 year range) are more likely to get “Skin Allergy” over time compared to other ages (which refers to 0-4 years old, 5-17 years old, and 5-9 years old) and sex groups (which refers to female).</p></li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Hay fever or respiratory allergy” is the most prevalent illness. It is worth some attention because it is the most common illness overall when analyzing the trends for various diseases over time, but also when analyzing the insured-uninsured status and various poverty levels.</p></li>
<li><p>Besides the illness “Hay fever or respiratory allergy,” “Skin allergy” also needs some attention as it is the illness that increases most over time.</p></li>
<li><p>It is suitable diving into the sub-categories for each demographic characteristic as different illnesses will have various constructions for sub-categories. It can provide some information about which groups of children are more likely to get this specific illness.</p></li>
<li><p>After combining the three sub-categories under the “Insured” status, it shows that the median percentage of children for “Insured” is higher than the median percentage for “Uninsured” status. It might be a good phenomenon, which shows that many children who suffer from those eight diseases are insured. However, it is still possible that the children with the insurance are more likely to go to the hospital, see the doctor, and be diagnosed.</p></li>
<li><p>For the poverty level, the sub-category “Below 100%” has a higher median percentage of children over time compared to other categories, which might show that many children suffering from those eight illnesses are at the “Below 100%” poverty level.</p></li>

<h1>Limitation</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Some percentages of children provided through the original data set are considered unreliable <span class="citation" data-cites="healthc2019">(<a href="#ref-healthc2019" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Health Conditions Among Children Under Age 18, by Selected Characteristics: United States, Average Annual, Selected Years 1997<span></span>1999 Through 2016<span></span>2018”</span> 2019</a>)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The data set includes the information for standard error for estimates, but this project barely includes them when doing the analysis. The information related to standard error only appeared when visualizing the sub-group information for “Hay fever or respiratory allergy” and “Skin allergy.”</p></li>
